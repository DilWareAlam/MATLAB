Dear Sir,
Please find the URL here: http://youngbangla.org/internship.php that I come across recently. Ministry of Telecommunication & IT and Ministry of Power Energy & Mineral Resource are offering internship opportunities where recent graduates or final year students have been called to apply. I felt like letting you know about this so that it is possible to circulate amongst our final year students. Since I myself am not quite sure how we can reach them, I am informing it to you. This can be a valuable experience for our students I believe.
Hope this will not cause any inconvenience.

Dear All,
You are cordially invited to join the seminar on Research Methodology, Ethics & Writing Strategies on 17th July, 2016 at 11:30 AM in the Seminar room Campus-B. The seminar will be conducted by Dr. Md. AtiqurRahmanAhad, Associate Professor, Department of EEE, University of Dhaka.

Abstract: Research is a systematic process by understanding the nature of problem to explore. Based on extensive and systematic literature review, one can dig into a few issues and decipher. One should propose or develop methods or ideas to solve the problem after extensive experimentation and analysis. Generalizing a proposed scheme or method is one of the core parts of a research. In this talk, various important aspects of research methodology will be covered. Core items and ideas will be explained from how to define a problem and how to conclude based on the experiments. Research ethics will be covered. Having some good results may not allow a researcher to publish in a challenging journal or conference related to the field of study. Many young researchers can’t identify where to submit, what core issues to be addressed before submission, etc. Selection of a related good journal or conference is important. Different facets of good publication will be discussed.
